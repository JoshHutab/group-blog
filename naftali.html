  <h1>Naftali's About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I’ve been collecting keychains lately, don’t ask me why, I just like ‘em. It started as a small thing and now I have way too many for someone who only owns one set of keys.
I wish I lived in Switzerland. It looks super peaceful, the views are insane, and honestly? I feel like I was born to just chill in a cozy cabin surrounded by mountains, doing absolutely nothing.
Also, I’m interested in becoming a psychologist. I started thinking about it in 10th grade after realizing how much I enjoyed sociology and maybe also because I like figuring out why people do weird things (including myself)
